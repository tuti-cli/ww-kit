# Security

**Security is a first-class citizen in ww-kit.** Skills downloaded from external sources (skills.sh, GitHub, URLs) can contain prompt injection attacks — malicious instructions hidden inside SKILL.md files that hijack agent behavior, steal credentials, or execute destructive commands.

ww-kit protects against this with a **mandatory two-level security scan** that runs before any external skill is used:

                ✅ Skill is safe to use
```

## Why Two Levels?

| Level | Catches | Misses |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Python scanner** | Known patterns, encoded payloads, invisible characters, HTML comment injections | Rephrased attacks, novel techniques |
| **LLM semantic review** | Intent and context, creative rephrasing, suspicious tool combinations | Encoded data, zero-width chars, binary payloads |

They complement each other — the scanner is deterministic and catches what LLMs might skip over; the LLM understands meaning and catches what regex can't express.

## Scan Results

- **CLEAN** (exit 0) — no threats, safe to install
- **BLOCKED** (exit 1) — critical threats detected, skill is deleted and user is warned
- **WARNINGS** (exit 2) — suspicious patterns found, user must explicitly confirm

A skill with **any CRITICAL threat is never installed**. No exceptions, no overrides.

## Running the Scanner Manually

```bash
# Scan a skill directory (use your agent's skills path)
python3 .claude/skills/wws-skill/scripts/security-scan.py ./my-downloaded-skill/

# Strict mode: code block examples are treated as real threats (no demotion)
python3 .claude/skills/wws-skill/scripts/security-scan.py --strict ./my-downloaded-skill/

# Scan a single SKILL.md file
python3 .claude/skills/wws-skill/scripts/security-scan.py ./my-skill/SKILL.md

# For other agents, adjust the path accordingly:
# python3 .codex/skills/wws-skill/scripts/security-scan.py ./my-skill/
# python3 .agents/skills/wws-skill/scripts/security-scan.py ./my-skill/
```

## Internal Self-Scan (ww-kit repo)

Built-in ww-kit skills contain security threat examples in documentation, which can trigger expected false positives.
For repository self-audits, use the internal allowlist:

```bash
./scripts/security-self-scan.sh
# or:
# python3 skills/wws-skill/scripts/security-scan.py \
#   --md-only \
#   --allowlist scripts/security-scan-allowlist-ai-factory.json \
#   skills/
```

Use `--allowlist` only for trusted first-party content. Do not use it when scanning external downloaded skills.
